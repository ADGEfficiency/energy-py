These notebooks are rough & ready where I check & protype ideas.

Eventually these will either be made into tests, made into examples or removed.

To make into tests:

- discounted returns calc - checking both the function and the in & out of memory

- processors - check that they all converge to proper means, stdevs etc

- maybe do a bit on making state actions
