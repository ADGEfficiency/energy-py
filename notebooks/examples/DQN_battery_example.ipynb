    "# DQN with Battery Example\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the ability of a DQN agent to learn to optimize electric battery storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example involves a constant and repetitive electricity price profile, combined with a perfect forecast. The agent has both the ability to memorize this profile and lives in a near Markov environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A real world application of using reinforcement learning to control a battery would have to deal with both a variable price profile and a non-Markov understanding of what the price profile would do in the future.  It could also involve additional reward signals, such as payments from fast frequency response needed to be balanced against price arbitrage."
